Throughout the course, we will be incrementally constructing a scalable web application for famous quotes.
The sequence the homeworks will follow is below:

Homework #2:
  Python/Flask MVP web application using sqlite3
    create and read operations
    update and delete as stretch goals.
Homework #3:
  Containerized version of Homework #2 uploaded to Docker Hub
Homework #4:
  Adds Cloud Datastore database backend deployed on Cloud Run

The application should support the submission and viewership of entries that are provided via a web form.
Submission of entries should support fields that can hold attributes typically related to the application
and are stored in a backend database. Examples include:

  * Quote
  * Person the quote is attributed to
  * Date of the quote (e.g. year, month, day)
  * Source type for the quote (e.g. book, speech, essay, movie, song)
  * Source of the quote (e.g. the Constitution, Barbie the Movie, "I Have a Dream", "Imagine")
  * Quote rating
